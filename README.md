# uuid-base64-codec
Encode TheBrain UUIDs to base64 or decode base64 to UUID.

[TheBrain](https://thebrain.com/) uses UUIDs for brain and thought IDs. For external use, they are standard UUIDs in ASCII hex. For internal use, the ASCII hex is encoded using base64.

The small Python app included here demonstrates how to encode / decode the UUIDs.
